- 2 principles of Marginal Gains: 

</div></div>

```

# Step 2: Pick your losses #imo
```ad-important
- What do I need to sacrafice in order for this goal to be achieved with the time that I got? 
	- It could be another goal, could be attributes, could be anything
- It doesn't have to be just losses, think of a thing that you need to cut out of your life to achieve another thing
- Expect the lost and accept the lost
- Alaways think about your losses, not just in this section, not just in this note, but as a pillar of your life
```
- Relatives time, aka watch movies together with my cousins in cinema or have fun on the weekend with them.
- Friends time, including going outside to hang out with them, play games with them online. I will only go with them if there's a dedicated, planned vacation on a specific occasion (Celebrating one's achievement, on holiday)
- If I don't get enough income to be the same or 10% lower as my previous job for the next 2 months, I have to get a 9 - 5 job to support myself

# Step 3: Dissect the goal
```ad-question
- What do you need in order to achieve this goal? (knowledge, skills, attributes, resources)?
- When the attribute you want to build stagnate:
	- Is there any other attribute you might not think of before?
	- Is there any attribute that you know you should improve, but you didn't?
```
## **Physical health**
- Have a strong foundation and advanced knowledge and techniques
	- [[1_Project/Gym/Foundation\|Foundation]]
- Be able to use it or recall to it when needed (Decoding)
- Self-discipline for tired days when I don't want to go the gym, or days when I just want to cut corners and finish early
- Humble to learn from others at the gym
- Fundamentals gym techniques
	- Breathing techniques
	- Exercises techniques
	- etc.
- Reflect on gym session(s) for the day/ week/ month depending on your knowledge and technique competency
	- E.g. If you're just starting out and don't know much about how to lift correctly, you might need to reflect a lot about it after trying out new technique
- Critical thinking: To find resources that is science-based
- Eating schedule to accommodate my fitness health 
- Resource:

## Decision-making 
- [How to make smart decisions more easily - YouTube](https://youtu.be/X7j8F16eSqs?si=cO68AoGDUanesQo2)
- Decision-making lessons in "Supplementary learning"
## Planning 
- After watching [Goal Setting Is a Hamster Wheel. Learn to Set Systems Instead. | Adam Alter | Big Think - YouTube](https://youtu.be/x44zEK39GOM), I realized that I've beaten myself up time and time again to reach a goal, only ended up realizing is unfathomable to reach, and quit it. I really need a good system to get stuff done.
	- Even though Marginal Gains and 30-day plan have to set goals, I feel like it justifiable, since you need to think about what the person that is likely to achieve that goal have, list out all factors and compare your factors to that ideal factors, and then working your way up. The goal is always on the top of every MGs and 30-day plan, but the factors to get there are the most important 
=> Daily planning is enough, for now

## **Focus and concentration** 
- Need to learn more about this

## **Time management and procrastination** 
- Need to learn more about this

## Studying skill 
- Able to make connections through many techniques that I basically use it without a second thought. I immediately know what to do without a cheat sheet telling me what should I do
- Able to know when to use words and when to use images in a mind map
	- Use images as an anchor for your brain to easily make more connections on information that is hard to remember, or wordy details that can be explaining easier with image
- Will add more things that I want to achieve when I have more knowledge about techniques that I will learn in iCanStudy

## Editing skill
### Fundamentals
#### Animation 
- Understand and utilize basic animation fundamentals to help create more dynamic and engaging motion graphics and character animations

## Freelancing skill 
### Networking => Finding gig[^1]

###  Marketing [^1]

### Pricing [^1]

### Networking/ Communication[^2] 
- I want to network with people to find people I can vibe with. 
	- To do this, I need to:
		- Learn improv, since it will help me:
			- Enhance my communication skills
			- Boost my creativity and quick thinking
			- Build confidence and overcome stage fright/ crowded environment
		- Expanding my knowledge on a particular hobby that I really enjoy doing, so that I can use it to break the ice with different people using simple words and phrases. To do this, I need to:
			- Find a hobby that I really enjoy
			- Have a strong foundation of skills and techniques


# Step 4: Evaluate your target level
## **Physical health: 9/10**
- I want to decrease my body fat and increase muscle, until I found myself: 
	1. Strong enough to lift heavy objects and going up/down stairs without breathing heavily
	2. Feeling firmed and toned on my skin/ in my body

## Planning: 8/10 
- I want to plan for long term (A week, a month, up to 3 months) based on data from processes that I've setup for tracking and reflecting (30-day plan, Marginal Gains). The schedule need to be reflect of what I've tracked and wanted to improve on, but don't need to be perfect that there's no room for error.

## Focus and concentration: 8/10
- While doing deep work:
	- I need to stop switching back and forth to another task while tackling the current one 	- I need to stop checking messaging apps like Zalo or Messenger, unless it's a urgent business

## **Time management and procrastination: 9/10** 
- I need to plan my task that account for other factor such as deadlines, buffer, break. Basically, it has to reflect the real world scenario.  
## Studying skill: 8/10 
- Need to improve on making more connections: Between one concept and another, combining concepts resulted in another concept, and other connections that I did not know about
- Changing parts from words to pictures when I start to forget

## Editing skill: 8/10
### Fundamentals
#### Animation
- I need to be able to understand the fundamentals in animation so that I can utilize plugins to aid my motion graphics or be able to make my own if there's isn't any assets that can support me

# Step 5: Evaluate your current level
## **Physical health: 4/10**
- Last cycle: 
	- I haven't go to the gym for 4 months, since I got back pain injured
	- Finished watching a bench press exercises that touch a bit about breathing, engage core and everything else about bench press's setup and correct form 
	- **Changed my score** that reflect more about my current understanding
- This cycle:
	- My bench press exercise has been verified through a checklist of all forms that I need to get it right in order to have a safe and effective exercise [[5_Others/Template/Bench press\|Bench press]]

## Focus and concentration: 6/10 
- I kept watching videos from YT's home/ feed page 
## **Time management and procrastination: 7/10**  
- Only one time, but the last cycle is just 3 days ago, and the procrastinate time is estimated about 40 mins 
## Studying skill: 5/10 
- I still can make connection, but some concepts still being isolated
- Mostly using all words when drawing mind map

## Editing skill: 4/10
### Fundamentals
#### Animation
- I currently don't know how to make/ utilize motion graphics for delivering audiences a dynamic and engaging experience 
# Step 6: Find the 1%
## Physical health
- [x] Set up an exercise routine for the week
	- Focus on exercises that improve back pain first
		- [How To Get A Strong Lower Back The RIGHT Way (4 Must Do Exercises) - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tnATDflg4o)
- Go to the gym and start practicing
	- Start small, doing one exercises while recording, then go back home and reflect on it

## Focus and concentration
