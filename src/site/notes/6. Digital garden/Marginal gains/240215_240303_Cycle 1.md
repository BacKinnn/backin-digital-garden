# Step 2: Pick your losses
```ad-important
- What do I need to sacrafice in order for this goal to be achieved with the time that I got? 
	- It could be another goal, could be attributes.
- Expect the lost and accept the lost
- Alaways think about your losses, not just in this section, not just in this note, but as a pillar of your life
```
- Relatives time, aka watch movies together in cinema or have fun on the weekend with my cousins.
- Friends time, including going outside to hang out with them, play games with them online. I will only go with them if there's a dedicated, planned vacation on a specific occasion (Celebrating one's achievement, on holiday)
- If I don't get enough income to be the same or 10% lower as my previous job for the next 2 months, I have to get a 9 - 5 job to support myself

# Step 3: Dissect the goal

## **Physical health**
- Have a strong foundation and advanced knowledge and techniques
	- [[1_Project/Gym/Foundation\|Foundation]]
- Be able to use it or recall to it when needed (Decoding)
- Self-discipline for tired days when I don't want to go the gym, or days when I just want to cut corners and finish early
- Humble to learn from others at the gym
- Fundamentals gym techniques
	- Breathing techniques
	- Exercises techniques
	- etc.
- Reflect on gym session(s) for the day/ week/ month depending on your knowledge and technique competency
	- E.g. If you're just starting out and don't know much about how to lift correctly, you might need to reflect a lot about it after trying out new technique
- Critical thinking: To find resources that is science-based
- Eating schedule to accommodate my fitness health 
- Resource:

			- Build confidence and overcome stage fright/ crowded environment
		- Expanding my knowledge on a particular hobby that I really enjoy doing, so that I can use it to break the ice with different people using simple words and phrases. To do this, I need to:

			- Have a strong foundation of skills and techniques

# Step 4: Evaluate your target level
## **Physical health: 9/10**
- I want to decrease my body fat and increase muscle, until I found myself: 
	1. Strong enough to lift heavy objects and going up/down stairs without breathing heavily
	2. Feeling firmed and toned on my skin/ in my body

## Planning: 8/10 
- I want to plan for long term (A week, a month, up to 3 months) based on data from processes that I've setup for tracking and reflecting (30-day plan, Marginal Gains). The schedule need to be reflect of what I've tracked and wanted to improve on, but don't need to be perfect that there's no room for error.

## **Focus and concentration: 8/10**
- While doing deep work:
	- I need to stop switching back and forth to another task while tackling the current one
{ #facdf2}

	- I need to stop checking messaging apps like Zalo or Messenger, unless it's a urgent business

## **Time management and procrastination: 9/10**
- I need to plan my task that account for other factor such as deadlines, buffer, break. Basically, it has to reflect the real world scenario. 
{ #90c13c}


## Studying skill: 8/10 
- Need to improve on making more connections: Between one concept and another, combining concepts resulted in another concept, and other connections that I did not know about
- Changing parts from words to pictures when I start to forget

# Step 5: Evaluate your current level
## **Physical health: 6/10**
- I haven't go to the gym for 4 months, since I got back pain injured
- I can still remember basic techniques: Correct form exercises, breathing, engage core

## Planning: 6/10 
- I can plan for the day. And although it's not perfect because life happen, it leaves me room for error to reflect and improve upon. 
- I still struggle with planning for the upcoming week and month. Best I could do is scheduling in non negotiable tasks like events or meetings or work. I need to find more information about this

## **Focus and concentration: 6/10**
- Last cycle: 
<div class="transclusion internal-embed is-loaded"><div class="markdown-embed">



	- I've batched my procrastination thoughts down, but I haven't go through all of it, even if I have free time. I just write down and forgot it exist. Further more, in some days, I forgot to write down distracting thoughts before I caught myself wasting time again. I did add another point in [[1_Project/YouTube/30-day plan/240123_Cycle 1#**Focus and concentration**\|240123_Cycle 1#**Focus and concentration**]] that basically tells me to write down how many percentage I successfully caught myself procrastinating and write down, and put it into "End of the day review", but this currently has too little data (2 out of 3 days) to draw any conclusion. I need at least a week 

</div></div>

	- My batching is more consistent this time. I wrote down my procrastination thoughts in paper, batch them into sticky notes, and put them in a standee

## **Time management and procrastination: 7/10** 
- Last cycle: 
<div class="transclusion internal-embed is-loaded"><div class="markdown-embed">



	- This has not been improve anything at all. I set up the alarm, but I don't have the data to notify me how many time I successfully stop 

</div></div>

	- This has been improved significantly. Compare to last cycle, I only watch after eating 2 - 3 times
{ #704121}


## Studying skill: 5/10 
- I still can make connection, but some concepts still being isolated
- Mostly using all words when drawing mind map

## Editing skill: 4/10 
- 

# Step 6: Find the 1%
## Physical health
- Set up an exercise routine for the week
	- Focus on exercises that improve back pain first
		- [How To Get A Strong Lower Back The RIGHT Way (4 Must Do Exercises) - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tnATDflg4o)
- Go to the gym and start practicing
	- Record yourself for reflection after a workout session
	- Start small

## Focus and concentration

	- My batching is more consistent this time. I wrote down my procrastination thoughts in paper, batch them into sticky notes, and put them in a standee  

</div></div>

- When I'm sitting down in front of a desk, I will have a **notebook** on the left side to write down procrastinated thoughts when I encounter them. 
	- When I'm not at the desk, I will use my phone to capture procrastinated thoughts
