# Step 2: Pick your losses #imo
```ad-important
- What do I need to sacrafice in order for this goal to be achieved with the time that I got? 
	- It could be another goal, could be attributes, could be anything
- It doesn't have to be just losses, think of a thing that you need to cut out of your life to achieve another thing
- Expect the lost and accept the lost
- Alaways think about your losses, not just in this section, not just in this note, but as a pillar of your life
```
- Relatives time, aka watch movies together with my cousins in cinema or have fun on the weekend with them.
- Friends time, including going outside to hang out with them, play games with them online. I will only go with them if there's a dedicated, planned vacation on a specific occasion (Celebrating one's achievement, on holiday)
- If I don't get enough income to be the same or 10% lower as my previous job for the next 2 months, I have to get a 9 - 5 job to support myself

# Step 3: Dissect the goal
```ad-question
- What do you need in order to achieve this goal? (knowledge, skills, attributes, resources)?
- When the attribute you want to build stagnate:
	- Is there any other attribute you might not think of before?
	- Is there any attribute that you know you should improve, but you didn't?
```

# Step 4: Evaluate your target level
## **Physical health: 9/10**
- I want to decrease my body fat and increase muscle, until I found myself: 
	1. Strong enough to lift heavy objects and going up/down stairs without breathing heavily
	2. Feeling firmed and toned on my skin/ in my body

## Planning: 8/10 
- I want to plan for long term (A week, a month, up to 3 months) based on data from processes that I've setup for tracking and reflecting (30-day plan, Marginal Gains). The schedule need to be reflect of what I've tracked and wanted to improve on, but don't need to be perfect that there's no room for error.

## Focus and concentration: 8/10
- While doing deep work:
	- I need to stop switching back and forth to another task while tackling the current one
{ #facdf2}

	- I need to stop checking messaging apps like Zalo or Messenger, unless it's a urgent business

## **Time management and procrastination: 9/10**
- I need to plan my task that account for other factor such as deadlines, buffer, break. Basically, it has to reflect the real world scenario. 
{ #90c13c}


## Studying skill: 8/10 
- Need to improve on making more connections: Between one concept and another, combining concepts resulted in another concept, and other connections that I did not know about
- Changing parts from words to pictures when I start to forget

# Step 5: Evaluate your current level
## **Physical health: 4/10**
- I haven't go to the gym for 4 months, since I got back pain injured
- Finished watching a bench press exercises that touch a bit about breathing, engage core and everything else about bench press's setup and correct form 
- **Changed my score** that reflect more about my current understanding

## Planning: 6/10 
- I can plan for the day. And although it's not perfect because life happen, it leaves me room for error to reflect and improve upon. 
- I still struggle with planning for the upcoming week and month. Best I could do is scheduling in non negotiable tasks like events or meetings or work. I need to find more information about this
{ #d418ae}


## Focus and concentration: 6/10
- Batching is still consistent, I have phone when I don't sit on work desk, and paper when I work on desk, so don't need to improve anything (for now)

## **Time management and procrastination: 7/10** 
- Only one time, but the last cycle is just 3 days ago, and the procrastinate time is estimated about 40 mins

## Studying skill: 5/10 
- I still can make connection, but some concepts still being isolated
- Mostly using all words when drawing mind map

## Editing skill: 4/10 
- 

# Step 6: Find the 1%
## Physical health
- [x] Set up an exercise routine for the week
	- Focus on exercises that improve back pain first
